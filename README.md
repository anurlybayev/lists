This is the place where I point people to, when they wish to give me a present.

## Books

I love books and recently I enjoy books about Art and photography. I prefer the Kindle or other ebook format to physical book due to lack of space in our dwelling, but sometimes that is not the option.

### Art and photography

* [Remake: Master Works of Art Reimagined](http://www.amazon.ca/Remake-Master-Works-Art-Reimagined/dp/1452123349/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438185986&sr=8-1&keywords=Remake%3A+Master+Works+of+Art+Reimagined)

### History and Biographies

* [Didier Drogba: The Autobiography](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/1845134389/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=35PZZN09M2C0U&coliid=IOXEYLC1DSMW1)
